- Make sure that your gif and all other cell outputs are present in your notebook!
Yes, all are present!

- Confirm that the digits are able to be reconstructed in the bottleneck
   - Make a few notes below talking about whether or not this is interesting and/or useful.

Yes the digits are able to be reconstructed in the bottleneck. This is extremely interesting. It allows us to capture the most important aspects of the input data, and reduces dimensionality. This is also useful because it shows us the process of encoder reducing the dimensionality of the input and focusing on the important aspects of the input, and then the decoder reconstructing the input.


- Confirm that the latent encoding's decomposition roughly matches with original data's.
   - Comment a bit on it. Is this a good sign? Does it have any use?
Yes, the latent encoding's decomposition roughly matches with original data’s. This is a good sign because the latent encoder’s decomposition classifies the input correctly. It is useful because it shows us that our model is working appropriately.

- Make sure both of your gifs are present in the notebook!

Yes, both are present!

- Talk about a potential application that you think it would be cool to applied VAEs to.

An extremely interesting application of VAEs would be synthetic data generation. Synthetic data is required when real data is unavailable due to privacy or due to lack of sources. VAEs which are used to learn latent representations can also be used to produce images.
